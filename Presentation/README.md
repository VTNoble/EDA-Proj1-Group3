Summary Report

Study:

The data analysis explores the population of adoptable dogs advertised on Petfinder in Georgia, specifically if differences in certain parameters have a relationship with the average number of days a dog spends on Petfinder.
Parameters analyzed in the analysis include size, gender, age, and location.
Findings:

The results of the analysis indicated the following:
Larger dogs spend more time on average on Petfinder than smaller dogs.
Female dogs spend more time on average on Petfinder than male dogs.
Older dogs spend more time on average on Petfinder than younger dogs.
Dogs located outside the perimeter of Atlanta spend more time on average on Petfinder than dogs located inside the perimeter of Atlanta.
Observations:

The analysis used average of all dogs in the categorical grouping. No outliers were excluded from the study, and sample sizes were not necessarily the same size.
The observed median values for the gender and location parameters were much closer than the average (mean) values tested in this study. This suggests that outliers may have a large effect on calculating the mean values. A further study that drops outlier samples, or extreme outliers, could be performed to further evaluate these parameters' effects on how long dogs are available on Petfinder before adoption.
Implications of the study:

Petfinder could use this analysis to focus efforts on finding compatible homes for dogs.

Efforts could include targeted marketing strategies for dogs that generally spend a longer average time on Petfinder.
Petfinder could use the study as baseline data to then measure and improve how long their dogs spend on Petfinder.
Future studies based on organization could also help optimize resource sharing between the groups to ultimately improve overall dog adoption rate.
